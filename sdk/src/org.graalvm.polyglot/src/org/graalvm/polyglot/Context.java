/**
 * A polyglot context for Graal guest languages that allows to {@link #eval(Source) evaluate} code.
 * A polyglot context represents the global runtime state of all {@link Engine#getLanguages()
 * installed} and {@link #newBuilder(String...) permitted} languages. Permitted languages are
 * {@link #initialize(String) initialized} lazily, when they are used for the first time. For many
 * operations of the context, a <i>language identifier</i> needs to be specified. A language
 * identifier is unique for each language.
 *
 * <h3>Evaluation</h3>
 *
 * A context allows to evaluate Guest language source code using {@link #eval(Source)}. This is
 * possible by evaluating {@link Source} objects or given a language identifier and code
 * {@link String}. The {@link #eval(Source) evaluation} returns either the result value or throws a
 * {@link PolyglotException} if a guest language error occurs.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b> for evaluation of a fragment of JavaScript code with a new context:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Context context = Context.create();
 * Value result = context.eval("js", "42");
 * assert result.asInt() == 42;
 * context.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>We first first create a new context with all installed languages as permitted languages.
 * <li>Next, we evaluate the expression "42" with language "js", which is the language identifier
 * for JavaScript. Since this is the first time we access JavaScript, it automatically gets
 * {@link #initialize(String) initialized} first.
 * <li>Then, we assert the result value by converting the result value as primitive <code>int</code>
 * .
 * <li>Finally, if the context is no longer needed, it is necessary to close it to ensure that all
 * resources are freed. Contexts are also {@link AutoCloseable} for use with the Java
 * {@code try-with-resources} statement.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * Contexts may be created either with default configuration using the {@link #create(String...)
 * create method} or with custom configuration using the {@link #newBuilder(String...) builder}.
 * Both methods allow to specify a subset of the installed languages as permitted languages. If no
 * language is specified then all installed languages are permitted. Using the builder method
 * {@link Builder#in(InputStream) input}, {@link Builder#err(OutputStream) error} and
 * {@link Builder#out(OutputStream) output} streams, {@link Builder#option(String, String) options},
 * and {@link Builder#arguments(String, String[]) application arguments} may be configured.
 * <p>
 * Options may be specified for {@link Engine#getLanguages() languages},
 * {@link Engine#getInstruments() instruments}, the {@link Engine#getOptions() engine} and the
 * {@link Engine#getOptions() compiler}. For {@link Language#getOptions() language options} the
 * option key consists of the {@link Language#getId() language id} plus a dot followed by the option
 * name (e.g. "js.Strict"). For most languages the option names start with an upper-case letter by
 * convention. A list of available options may be received using {@link Language#getOptions()}.
 * {@link Instrument#getOptions() Instrument options} are structured in the same way as language
 * options but start with the {@link Instrument#getId() instrument id} instead.
 * <p>
 * If system properties are {@link Engine.Builder#useSystemProperties(boolean) enabled}, which they
 * are by default, then all polyglot options maybe specified with the prefix "polyglot." (e.g.
 * "-Dpolyglot.js.Strict=true"). The system properties are read only once when the context or engine
 * instance is created. After that changes to the system properties have no affect.
 * <p>
 * Each Graal language performs an initialization step before it can be used to execute code, after
 * which it remains initialized for the lifetime of the context. Initialization is by default lazy
 * and automatic, but initialization can be forced {@link Context#initialize(String) manually} if
 * needed.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b> for custom configuration using the context builder:
 *
 * <pre>
 * OutputStream myOut = new BufferedOutputStream()
 * Context context = Context.newBuilder("js", "R")
 *                          .out(myOut)
 *                          .option("js.Strict", "true")
 *                          .allowAllAccess(true)
 *                          .build();
 * context.eval("js", "42");
 * context.eval("R", "42");
 * context.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>We first first create a new context with all installed languages as permitted languages.
 * <li>Next, we evaluate the expression "42" with language "js", which is the language identifier
 * for JavaScript. Since this is the first time we access JavaScript, it first gets
 * {@link #initialize(String) initialized} as well.
 * <li>Then, we assert the result value by converting the result value as primitive <code>int</code>
 * .
 * <li>Finally, if the context is no longer needed, it is necessary to close it to ensure that all
 * resources are freed. Contexts are also {@link AutoCloseable} for use with the Java
 * {@code try-with-resources} statement.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Bindings</h3>
 *
 * The symbols of the top-most scope of a language can be accessed using the
 * {@link #getBindings(String) language bindings}. Each language provides its own bindings object
 * for a context. The bindings object may be used to read, modify, insert and delete members in the
 * top-most scope of the language. Certain languages may not allow write access to the bindings
 * object. See {@link #getBindings(String)} for details.
 * <p>
 * A context instance also provides access to the {@link #getPolyglotBindings() polyglot} bindings.
 * The polyglot bindings are shared between languages and may be used to exchange values. See
 * {@link #getPolyglotBindings()} for details.
 * <p>
 * <b>Examples</b> using language bindings from JavaScript:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Context context = Context.create("js");
 * Value jsBindings = context.getBindings("js")
 *
 * jsBindings.putMember("foo", 42);
 * assert context.eval("js", "foo").asInt() == 42;
 *
 * context.eval("js", "var bar = 42");
 * assert jsBindings.getMember("bar").asInt() == 42;
 *
 * assert jsBindings.getMember("Math")
 *                  .getMember("abs")
 *                  .execute(-42)
 *                  .asInt() == 42;
 * context.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>We create a new context with JavaScript as the only permitted language.
 * <li>Next, we load the JavaScript bindings object and assign it to a local variable
 * <code>jsBindings</code>.
 * <li>Then, we insert a new member <code>foo</code> into to the bindings object and verify that the
 * object is accessible within the language by reading from a global symbol with the same name.
 * <li>After that, we declare a new global variable in JavaScript and verify that it is accessible
 * as member of the language bindings object.
 * <li>Next, we access we access a JavaScript builtin named <code>Math.abs</code> symbol and execute
 * it with -42. This result is asserted to be 42.
 * <li>Finally, we close the context to free all allocated resources.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Host Interoperability</h3>
 *
 * It is often necessary to interact with values of the host runtime within Graal guest languages.
 * Such objects are referred to as <i>host objects</i>. Every Java value that is passed to a Graal
 * language is interpreted according to the specification described in {@link #asValue(Object)}.
 * Also see {@link Value#as(Class)} for further details.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b> using a Java object from JavaScript:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class JavaRecord {
 *     public int x;
 *
 *     public String name() {
 *         return "foo";
 *     }
 * }
 * Context context = Context.create();
 *
 * JavaRecord record = new JavaRecord();
 * context.getBindings("js").putMember("javaRecord", record);
 *
 * context.eval("js", "record.x = 42");
 * assert record.x == 42;
 *
 * context.eval("js", "record.name()").asString().equals("foo");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Error Handling</h3>
 *
 * Guest languages code may fail when executing guest language code or when accessing guest language
 * object. So almost all methods in the {@link Context} and {@link Value} API throw a
 * {@link PolyglotException} in case an error occurs. See {@link PolyglotException} for further
 * details on error handling.
 *
 * <h3>Isolation</h3>
 *
 * Each context is by default isolated from all other instances with respect to both language
 * evaluation semantics and resource consumption. By default a new context instance has no access to
 * host resources, like threads, files or loading new host classes. To allow access to such
 * resources either the individual access right must be granted or
 * {@link Builder#allowAllAccess(boolean) all access} must be set to <code>true</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Contexts can be {@linkplain Builder#engine(Engine) configured} to share certain system resources
 * like ASTs, optimized code by specifying a single underlying engine; see {@link Engine} for more
 * details about code sharing.
 *
 * <h3>Proxies</h3>
 *
 * The {@link Proxy proxy interfaces} allow to mimic guest language objects, arrays, executables,
 * primitives and native objects in Graal languages. Every Graal language will treat instances of
 * proxies like an object of that particular language. Multiple proxy interfaces can be implemented
 * at the same time. For example, it is useful to provide proxy values that are objects with members
 * and arrays at the same time.
 *
 * <h3>Thread-Safety</h3>
 *
 * It is safe to use a context instance from a single thread. It is also safe to use it with
 * multiple threads if they do not access the context at the same time. Whether a single context
 * instance may be used from multiple threads at the same time depends on if all initialized
 * languages support it. If only languages are initialized that support multi-threading then the
 * context instance may be used from multiple threads at the same time. If a context is used from
 * multiple threads and the language does not fit then an {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown by
 * the accessing method.
 * <p>
 * Meta-data from the context's underlying {@link #getEngine() engine} can be retrieved safely by
 * any thread at any time.
 * <p>
 * A context may be {@linkplain #close() closed} from any thread, but only if the context is not
 * currently executing code. If a context is currently executing code, a different thread may kill
 * the currently runnign execution and close the context using {@link #close(boolean)}.
 *
 * <h3>Pre-Initialization</h3>
 *
 * The Context pre-initialization can be used to perform expensive builtin creation in the time of
 * native compilation.
 * <p>
 * The context pre-initialization is enabled by setting the system property
 * {@code polyglot.engine.PreinitializeContexts} to a comma separated list of language ids which
 * should be pre-initialized, for example: {@code -Dpolyglot.engine.PreinitializeContexts=js,python}
 * <p>
 * See
 * {@code com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage.patchContext(java.lang.Object, com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage.Env)}
 * for details about pre-initialization for language implementers.

     * the identity.
     * <p>
     * When a host value is converted to a polyglot value the following rules apply:
     * <ol>
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is <code>null</code> then it will be interpreted as
     * polyglot {@link Value#isNull() null}.
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is already a {@link Value polyglot value} then it will be
     * cast to {@link Value}.
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is an instance of {@link Byte}, {@link Short},
     * {@link Integer}, {@link Long}, {@link Float} or {@link Double} then it will be interpreted as
     * polyglot {@link Value#isNumber() number}. Other subclasses of {@link Number} will be
     * interpreted as {@link Value#isHostObject() host object} (see later).
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is an instance of {@link Character} or {@link String} then
     * it will be interpreted as polyglot {@link Value#isString() string}.
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is an instance of {@link Boolean} then it will be
     * interpreted as polyglot {@link Value#isBoolean() boolean}.
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is a {@link Proxy polyglot proxy} then it will be
     * interpreted according to the behavior specified by the proxy. See the javadoc of the proxy
     * subclass for further details.
     * <li>If the <code>hostValue</code> is a non-primitive {@link Value#as(Class) mapped Java
     * value} then the original value will be restored. For example if a guest language object was
     * mapped to {@link Map} then the original object identity will be preserved when converting
     * back to a polyglot value.
     * <li>Any other <code>hostValue</code> will be interpreted as {@link Value#isHostObject() host
     * object}. Host objects expose all their public java fields and methods as
     * {@link Value#getMember(String) members}. In addition, Java arrays and subtypes of
     * {@link List} will be interpreted as value with {@link Value#hasArrayElements() array
     * elements} and single method interfaces annotated with {@link FunctionalInterface} are
     * {@link Value#execute(Object...) executable} directly. Java {@link Class} instances are
     * interpreted as {@link Value#canInstantiate() instantiable}, but they do not expose Class
     * methods as members.
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * <b>Basic Examples:</b>
     *
     * The following assertion statements always hold:
     *
     * <pre>
     * Context context = Context.create();
     * assert context.asValue(null).isNull();
     * assert context.asValue(42).isNumber();
     * assert context.asValue("42").isString();
     * assert context.asValue('c').isString();
     * assert context.asValue(new String[0]).hasArrayElements();
     * assert context.asValue(new ArrayList<>()).isHostObject();
     * assert context.asValue(new ArrayList<>()).hasArrayElements();
     * assert context.asValue((Supplier<Integer>) () -> 42).execute().asInt() == 42;
     * </pre>
     *
     * <h1>Mapping to Java methods and fields</h1>
     *
     * When Java host objects are passed to guest languages, their public methods and fields are
     * provided as {@link Value#getMember(String) members}. Methods and fields are grouped by name,
     * so only one member is exposed for each name.
     * <p>
     * When an argument value needs to be mapped to match a required Java method parameter type then
     * the semantics of {@link Value#as(Class) host value mapping} is used. The result of the
     * mapping is equivalent of calling {@link Value#as(Class)} with the parameter type. Therefore a
     * {@link ClassCastException} or {@link NullPointerException} is thrown if a parameter value
     * cannot be cast to the required parameter type.
     * <p>
     * Overloaded java methods are selected based on the arguments that are provided. In case
     * multiple mapped Java methods with the same name are applicable for
     * {@link Value#execute(Object...) executions} or {@link Value#newInstance(Object...)
     * instantiations} then the method with the most concrete method with applicable arguments will
     * be used used.
     * <p>
     * The following parameter type hierarchy is used for method resolution. Left-most parameter
     * types are prioritized over types to their right.
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@link Value#isBoolean() Boolean} values: boolean, Boolean, Object
     * <li>String values: char, Character, String, CharSequence, Object
     * <li>Number values: byte, Byte, short, Short, int, Integer, long, Long, float, Float, double,
     * Double, Number, Object
     * <li>Other values are resolved based on their Java type hierarchy.
     * </ul>
     * If there are multiple most concrete methods or too many arguments were provided then an
     * illegal argument type error will be raised.
     * <p>
     * <b>Advanced Example:</b>
     *
     * This example first creates a new instance of the Java class <code>Record</code> and inspects
     * it first using the polyglot value API and later using the JavaScript guest language.

     * In the following examples all assertions hold.
